Task Description:
#### Task 1: To test the specific hypothesis by knowing the client & their problems.
1. Analysed the problem statement defined by the client i.e. power & electricity provider company.
2. formulated the imp features needed for solving the problem.
3. As per the SME of PowerCo 20% discount could solve the churning problem.
4. Problem statement and steps to carry them out is defined in this task.
see in EDA on PoerCo data.

#### Task 2: EDA is performed on the data given by PowerCo
Key insights drawn from the dataset
1. Approximately 10% of customers have churned
2. sumption data is highly skewed and must be treated before modelling
3. there are outliers present in the data and these must be treated before modelling
5. Feature engineering will be vital, especially if we are to increase the predictive power of price
sensitivity.

#### Task 3: Feature Engineering and modelling
1. Derived the features and created various other new features over monthly and yearly price effect basis.
2. most of the work was to create new features and for scaling & removing outliers from the dataset.
3. did PCA to visualza the data & for improving the accuracy score as well.
4. from PCA model selection was carried out.
5. tried with KNN, LogisticRegression, and finally landed with RandomForest coz, data was imbalanced and not scaled as well.

####  Task 4: Findings and Recommendation
1. You can see the findings on findings & recommendation ppt


## Tools Used
1. AWS Sagemaker Studio- EDA & Model Building.
2. AWS S3.
